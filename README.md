This repository includes files used to control the dual-inlet system of the TILDAS at the Geochemistry and Isotope Geology Department, Geoscience Center, University of GÃ¶ttingen.

The methodology is described in a paper currently in prep. All files relevant to the article are stored in the **Paper** folder.

The computers codes in this package were written by Andreas Pack and David Bajnai.
